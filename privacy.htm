                <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>Effective Date: February 2, 2018</p>

                <p>Welcome to Neocolor. 
                    PAH Ventures, LLC and its affiliates (collectively, “Neocolor,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) transform your photos into meaningful artistic coloring books.  We developed this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, share, and protect your Personal Information (defined below), and your choices about the collection and use of your Personal Information.
                    This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information collected or processed through our websites (collectively, the “Site”) and applications (collectively, the “App”) that link to this Privacy Policy (the Site together with the App, collectively, the “Service”).
                </p>
                <hr>

                <h3>1.  What is Personal Information?</h3>
                <p>“Personal Information” is information that, either alone or in combination with other information, identifies you. When we combine other information (i.e., information that does not, on its own, identify you) with your Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information.</p>
                <hr>

                <h3>2. How We Collect and Use Personal Information</h3>
                <h4>A.  Information that You Provide Us</h4>
                <p>We collect the following types of information that you provide to us:
                
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Contact, Account, and Payment Information.</b>
                    <p>We process Personal Information that you provide through creation and management of your account, such as your name and email address. We also process payment information, via a third-party service provider, if you choose to purchase photo packages through the Service.
                    We process this Personal Information only as necessary to provide the Service to you under the terms of our Terms of Use or for our legitimate interests in providing a Service that meets your needs and expectations.  For example, we use this information to accept payments from you; respond to your inquiries regarding the Service; facilitate our account recovery services in the event you forget your log-in credentials; and for other purposes related to the reasons for which you provide your Personal Information.
                    We use your email address to contact you from time to time in furtherance of our legitimate interests in providing you with information regarding the Service, such as payment receipts, information regarding critical updates to the Service, and security notices.    
                    </p>
                    </li>  
                    
                    <li><b>User ID and Password Information.</b>
                    <p>We process user ID and password information to enable you to log into and use the Service.  We process this Personal Information only as necessary to provide the Service to you under our <a href="terms.htm">Terms of Use</a>.  In the event you are able to log into our Service through a social networking site (e.g., Facebook or Twitter), we may receive Personal Information in accordance with the privacy policy of that site, which we may add to information you have already provided us. </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><b>User Content and Metadata.</b>
                    <p>We process your content, which includes photos and other materials that you post through the Service, and may include Personal Information. To facilitate the Service and to make certain features available to you, we also process “metadata” related to your content.  Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with your content. For example, metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of user content was collected and how that content is formatted.  You can also add metadata to your content, such as a hashtag.  We process your content and related metadata only as necessary to provide the Service to you under the terms of our <a href="terms.htm">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

                    <b>Cookies, Device Identifiers, and Similar technologies.</b>
                    <p>When you use or access the Service, we use cookies, device identifiers, and similar technologies such as pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Neocolor.  We process the information, including Personal Information, collected through such technologies to further our legitimate interests in operating the Service, enhancing your experience through personalization, and helping us better understand the features of the Service that you and other users are most interested in.   In addition, we and our advertisers may use cookies, device identifiers, and similar technologies to provide you with personalized advertisements which provide a source of revenue to continue to allow us to provide the Service to you. </p>
                    <p>Most browsers provide you with the ability to block, delete, or disable cookies, and your mobile device may allow you to disable transmission of device identifiers. If you choose to reject cookies or block device identifiers, some features of the Service may not be available or some functionality may be limited or unavailable.  If you disable cookies or device identifiers, you may continue to receive advertisements, but these advertisements will no longer be tailored to you.  Please review your help pages of your browser or mobile device for assistance with changing your settings.</p>

We may also collect similar information from emails sent to you which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. We use Log File Information collected from our implementation of the Service to further our legitimate interests in securing the Service by identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities, and in analyzing the effectiveness of our Service to improve the Service’s function and content.  </p>
