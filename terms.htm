                <h3>1. Description of Services</h3>
                <p>Neocolor is an application that uses artificial intelligence algorithms and proprietary deep learning models to transform your photos into sketches that can be colored as a sketch in a coloring book. The application allows you to upload preexisting photos onto the application. Once you choose a photo, Neocolor’s algorithm runs, transforming the photo into a sketch that can be colored. Once colored you can then share the photos through social media sites or store them for personal use. </p>
                <p><b>Please be aware that you are responsible for retaining copies of all photos submitted to the Service.  Neocolor does not return the original versions of submitted photos, and you cannot retrieve such photos after submitting them.</b></p>

Accordingly, if you are uncertain whether Third-Party Submission infringes your or others’ copyrights, please consult with a copyright attorney prior to making a notice under the DMCA.</p>

                <h3>15. Governing Law</h3>
                <p>This Agreement and the rights of the Parties hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16).</p> 
                <hr>
                
                <h3>16. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration</h3>
                <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH NEOCOLOR AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>
                <h4>A.  Arbitration</h4>
                <p>To the extent feasible, the Parties desire to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to your use of or access of the Service, this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of this Agreement, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitration (a <b>“Dispute”</b>) through discussions and negotiations between each other. The Parties agree to attempt to resolve any Disputes by negotiation with the other Party (by phone, electronic correspondence, or written correspondence). If, after good faith discussions, the Dispute(s) cannot be resolved solely between the Parties, such Dispute(s) will be determined by arbitration in the English language in Maricopa County, Arizona before a single arbitrator.</p>
                <p>The arbitration will be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (<b>“JAMS”</b>) in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (<b>“Rules”</b>) of JAMS, which are available on the JAMS website and hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
                <p>You and Neocolor agree that the state or federal courts sitting in Maricopa County, Arizona have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.  This provision will not preclude Parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. </p>
                
                <h4>B.  Conduct of Arbitration</h4>
                <p>The arbitration will be commenced by the claimant party filing a demand for arbitration with JAMS and serving the demand on the opposing party. Within 30 calendar days of the date the demand for arbitration is filed, the Parties will select an arbitrator by following the Rules’ arbitrator selection procedures. Except as may be required by law, neither Party nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration under this Agreement without the prior written consent of both Parties. The arbitrator’s award will be in writing, in the English language, and accompanied by a reasoned opinion and a written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.  </p>
                
                <h4>C.  Costs</h4>
                <p>You and Neocolor agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Neocolor will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Neocolor, Neocolor will pay all JAMS fees and costs.</p>
                
                <h4>D.  Limitation of Liability</h4>
                <p>In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator may not award any incidental, indirect, or consequential damages, including damages for lost profits or any punitive or exemplary damages.</p>
                
                <h4>E.  Arbitration is on an Individual Basis Only; Class Action Waiver</h4>
                <p>THE PARTIES AGREE TO ARBITRATE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT PERMIT CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ARBITRATOR’S POWER TO RULE ON HIS OR HER OWN JURISDICTION AND THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, THE ARBITRATOR HAS NO POWER TO RULE ON THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. IN THE EVENT THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATION IS DEEMED INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THIS SECTION 16 WILL REMAIN IN FORCE.</p>
